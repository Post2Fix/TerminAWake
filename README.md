Create an easily executable script file to disable the MacOS sleep for a time specified during execution.

This app prevents sleep on battery, while charging and when a MacBook lid is closed.

- Run ```chmod +x [path to 'awake' file]``` to make it executable

# Simple script execution examples:

- ```./awake 90s``` - stay awake for 90 seconds

- ```./awake 24h``` - stay awake for 24 hours

- ```./awake 30``` - stay awake for 30 minutes (no suffix default)

- ```./awake``` - stay awake indefinitely
